## Acknowledgments
The foundation for this library was developed during my work at the <a href="https://h2t.anthropomatik.kit.edu/">High Performance Humanoid Technologies (HÂ²T)</a> lab at the <a href="https://kit.edu">Karlsruhe Institute of Technologie (KIT)</a>.
It has since been adapted to become a general-purpose library.

## Todos
- Tests: I haven't yet had time to get started, but this is important.
- Documentation: Currently, the documentation is pretty much non-existent.
- TROP, priority-based memory, dueling DQN, A3C, async DQN, ...
